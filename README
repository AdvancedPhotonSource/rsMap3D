rsMap3D is a Python program for transforming a set of images collected as part of an 
x-ray scattering experiment into a 3D reciprocal space map.  


Version 1.0.8 of xrayutilities was tested on Windows 7 with:
      6/10/2016
      xrayutilities-1.2.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl found at 
      https://confluence.aps.anl.gov/display/RSM/Binary+Distributions+of+Python+Packages
      
      spec2nexus 2016.0601.0 installed via pip install from pypi.
      
      For Mac and Linux, it is best to use the same versions from pypi install 
      with pip install
      
      Fixed an issue with calculating angles when doing sixc geometry and 
      scanning a real angle.  The code was acting like it needed to compute from
      pseudo angle scan.
      
Version 1.0.9 testes with same versions as above:
      Fixed an issue with pole figure maps.  Had a couple of bugs left from
      recent refactoring.
      
Version 1.0.10 
      Test with  same xrayutilites
      Add code to Sector33SpecDataSource to handle runs that have been aborted.
      To work with spec files that have beamline specific entries, not handled by 
      a plugin must have spec2nexus version 2016.0615.1. 

Version 1.0.13   -  2016/10/27
      The structure of input and output controls, and on the back end DataSource 
      classes and Mapper classes have been reworked to allow output of data to 
      different formats.  In particular, the input Forms hold information on what 
      type of output is allowed/needed for that kind of data.  Up till this point,
      only output to VTI files was allowed.  A stock list of input forms is still 
      provided.  A pull-down combo box allows switching between input forms,  As
      a different form is selected, a list of allowed output forms is created and 
      placed on the "Process Data" tab.  The default form is set active.  Each output 
      form can then also specify a list of "Writers" to be used for selecting the format
      of the output data.  At this point vti (the only choice till now), a stack of TIFF 
      images, slicing through the 3D volume, and for XPCS data, a CSV file containing the 
      qx, qy, qz values for the single position used to collect time series data in an 
      XPCS scan.
      Energy scan data from sector 34 is working, but at present writes only VTI files.
      The Sector 33 scan format is working for sector 7, & 30.  Still working along with
      these beamlines to do some post processing.
      
Version 1.0.14   -  2016/10/27
      Needed to fix list of packages in setup.py did a re-release.      

Version 1.0.15   -  2016/10/27
      Needed to fix list of packages in setup.py did a re-release.
      
Version 1.0.16   -  2016/10/31
      Needed to fix handling method when pyimm is not found.ZZ
      
Version 1.0.17	- Changes to allow output of ascii vti file.

Version 1.0.18	- 2016-11-8 
       Readd missing string constant in common strings file.
       
Version 1.0.19	- 2016-11-8 
       Readd missing string logger constants in common strings file.
       
Version 1.0.20  - 2017-03-03
		Changed the Signal/Slot mechanism to use a newer version that will be 
		used moving forward.  This will allow moving more easily to Python 3 and
		PyQt 5.x.  Note that for now there are issues with VTK/PyQt integration
		with PyQt 5.x so for now need to stick with PyQt 4.11 and Python 2.7.
		Fixed a problem introduced when the output of data was split out into 
		writers.  The calculation of y data (qy or k) was using x-data instead of 
		Y.  This did not cause a problem when X&Y were using same range but
		when they were different, qy/k was wrong.
		
Version 1.1.0   - 2017-05-22
        Switch Configuration to use python's config parser
        Made it possible to edit which 
        
Version 1.1.1    - 2017-06-08
        Change the angle mapping code esp in S33SpecDataSource so that the angle
        mapping function can live in a module outside of the S33SpecDataSource 
        class.  This will make it easier for the user to add mapping functions.
        Now they would simply need to add a module to the PYTHONPATH, and add 
        the module name (w/ package path if necessary).  

Version 1.1.2    - 2017-06-08
	Revert s1highenergydatasource to a previous version with no mpi

Version 1.1.3    - 2017-06-08
	Remove @profile from s1highenergydatasource

Version 1.1.4    - 2017-06-08
	Remove @profile from s1highenergydatasource didn't take last time.

Version 1.1.5    - 2017-08-01	
    Add support for ccdscans from the XPCS beamlines.  This uses spec to scan 
    and store angle information and IMM files (local to APS) to store images.
    The spec file has '#CCD ccdscan scannum' line to indicate this type of scan.
    For now supporting subtraction of dark images (averaged without the first 
    dark Image, reading the location of files from the '#CCD image_dir' line
    and replacing the base part of this image directory for cases where the 
    data has been copied to another computer.
	
Version 1.1.6     - 2017-08-04
    To keep up with some interpreter versions being sensitive to this have
    switched '== None' with 'is None'
    
Version 1.1.7
    Add powderscan output for sector 33.  
    Play around with new setup.py.  Added resources directory with example xml
    and also get the LICENSE file into the distro.
    
Version 1.1.8   2017-11-7
    Fix problem selecting only a one or two images to process from a scan.  This 
    caused a problem if the size of the scan was such that processing was
    done in a number of passes based on user defined amount of memory to use 
    and the size and number of images to process.  
    Add Powder scan form into the S33 scan form.
    
Version 1.1.9   2017-11-7
    Fix Gridmapper to show 100% when done.
    Fix S1 to show 100% when done loading.
    
Version 1.2.0rc1 2019-04-02
    The major change is to switch to Python 3 and PyQt5, and VTK 8.2, with 
    as little change to the overall code as psosible.  So far, this has
    been tested on Mac with Anaconda Python (custom version has been updated),
    with conda 4.6.7(conda-build version: 3.4.1), python 3.6.8.final.0.
    
Version 1.2.0rc2 2019-04-02
    Fix a bug creating an new configuration file when one does not exist.  

Version 1.2.0rc2 2019-04-02
    Mostly fix issues in Py2 to 3 conversion.  File dialogs now return a 
    list even for single file operations.  Needed to pick list element as 0th
    element in using single file selection.
