Version 1.0.8 of xrayutilities was tested on Windows 7 with:
      6/10/2016
      xrayutilities-1.2.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl found at 
      https://confluence.aps.anl.gov/display/RSM/Binary+Distributions+of+Python+Packages
      
      spec2nexus 2016.0601.0 installed via pip install from pypi.
      
      For Mac and Linux, it is best to use the same versions from pypi install 
      with pip install
      
      Fixed an issue with calculating angles when doing sixc geometry and 
      scanning a real angle.  The code was acting like it needed to compute from
      pseudo angle scan.
      
Version 1.0.9 testes with same versions as above:
      Fixed an issue with pole figure maps.  Had a couple of bugs left from
      recent refactoring.
      
Version 1.0.10 
      Test with  same xrayutilites
      Add code to Sector33SpecDataSource to handle runs that have been aborted.
      To work with spec files that have beamline specific entries, not handled by 
      a plugin must have spec2nexus version 2016.0615.1.
